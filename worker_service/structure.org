- Message bus
  - send message of type for user
  - add listeners
  - return backlog
- Commands
  - has a prerequisite
  - has a post requisite
  - notification (to notify that something has been executed)
  - and a way to execute the command
- When constructing a command
  - it's prerequisite is run
  - then it's execute() is ran
  - finally it's post requisite is ran
- Prerequisite
  - Registers it's self in the message bus
  - Then checks if the prerequisite has already occurred

- Transactions outside of the worker are all done over a single
  channel to access the websocket.
  - This way we won't have multiple workers using the websocket at the same time
  - Results can be broadcasted over the message bus
